# TA-Java

# All of these labs and extra credits were written by JJ Shepherd (https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/jeremiahshepherd.php)
# 
# Labs 0 and 1 don't have a Java project as they are merely a beginner lab, and setting up an IDE.
# EC 1-4 don't have a Java project file either as I wasn't required to do them, however I helped many students work on them.
